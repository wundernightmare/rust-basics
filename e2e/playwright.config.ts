/**
 * Playwright configuration for the rust-basics e2e suite.
 *
 * Tests are pure API tests (no browser) — they drive the services through
 * Playwright's APIRequestContext. Unlike the Rust sibling repo there is no
 * Testcontainers infrastructure to start: these services have no datastores,
 * so globalSetup just spawns the (pre-built) Go binaries and globalTeardown
 * stops them.
 *
 *   globalSetup    → spawn services/ping/bin/ping + services/heartbeat/bin/heartbeat
 *   globalTeardown → kill them (pids tracked in .e2e-state.json)
 *
 * Run `just e2e-build` first (it builds the binaries the harness spawns).
